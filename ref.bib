abstract = {We explore the evolution of a select grid of solar metallicity stellar models from their pre-main-sequence phase to near their final fates in a neutrino Hertzsprung–Russell diagram, where the neutrino luminosity replaces the traditional photon luminosity. Using a calibrated MESA solar model for the solar neutrino luminosity ( ·  ×  1031 erg s−1) as a normalization, we identify ≃0.3 MeV electron neutrino emission from helium burning during the helium flash (peak , flux  (10 pc/d)2 cm−2 s−1 for a star located at a distance of d parsec, timescale ≃3 days) and the thermal pulse (peak , flux  × 107 (10 pc/d)2 cm−2 s−1, timescale ≃0.1 yr) phases of evolution in low-mass stars as potential probes for stellar neutrino astronomy. We also delineate the contribution of neutrinos from nuclear reactions and thermal processes to the total neutrino loss along the stellar tracks in a neutrino Hertzsprung–Russell diagram. We find, broadly but with exceptions, that neutrinos from nuclear reactions dominate whenever hydrogen and helium burn, and that neutrinos from thermal processes dominate otherwise.}

abstract = {The exploration of the universe has recently entered a new era thanks to the multi-messenger paradigm, characterized by a continuous increase in the quantity and quality of experimental data that is obtained by the detection of the various cosmic messengers (photons, neutrinos, cosmic rays and gravitational waves) from numerous origins. They give us information about their sources in the universe and the properties of the intergalactic medium. Moreover, multi-messenger astronomy opens up the possibility to search for phenomenological signatures of quantum gravity. On the one hand, the most energetic events allow us to test our physical theories at energy regimes which are not directly accessible in accelerators; on the other hand, tiny effects in the propagation of very high energy particles could be amplified by cosmological distances. After decades of merely theoretical investigations, the possibility of obtaining phenomenological indications of Planck-scale effects is a revolutionary step in the quest for a quantum theory of gravity, but it requires cooperation between different communities of physicists (both theoretical and experimental). This review, prepared within the COST Action CA18108 “Quantum gravity phenomenology in the multi-messenger approach”, is aimed at promoting this cooperation by giving a state-of-the art account of the interdisciplinary expertise that is needed in the effective search of quantum gravity footprints in the production, propagation and detection of cosmic messengers.}
